            Long gone are the good old days when a cat's biggest worries were
            mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online
            predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a
            post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other threats to their
            nine lives.

            stood at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare
            our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread
            having with their pets.
